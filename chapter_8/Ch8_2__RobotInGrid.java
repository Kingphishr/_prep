 Robot in a Grid: Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns.
 The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that
 the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to
 the bottom right.
